md_Hello	Simple Hello World Application

md_AnalogClock	Analog Clock Face -- Demos Line,Circle Drawing, Fast Sine/Cosine Lookup Tabels

md_DemoLCD	Collection of graphics demos rolled into one program including
		  Line, Circle and Ellispe Drawing
		  Blit - Small Area XOR and Screeen Horizontal Scroll 
		  QWERTY Keyboard
		  Analog Clock Demo
		  Large Text Digital Clock
		  Dithered Drawing
		  Text Rotation
		  Convex Area Fill (Paint)

md_RadarScope	Simulated Radar Scope 
		Similar to analog clock face
		still under development -- might be nice to tie to sensor on rotating boom
		with real input, versus simulated


md_Oscope	Simple Oscilloscope using ADC inputs (UserADC Scope is faster)


md_SonarSweep   Demonstrates sonar support with interface to Deventech SR04 Sonar and also Hobby RC
                Servo Drive. With a sonar module mounted on a servo, this demo will provide a sweeping
		motion to the servo and draw a polar plot of the range data.

md_Timer2Sound  Timer2 generates fine frequency control over speaker by taking over its output pin
		with no distortion from interrupt routines (direct timer to pin)



md_TimerSound	Timer1 generates fine frequency control over speaker using an interrupt routine.
		More range than md_Timer2Sound, but suceptable to distortion from competing 
 		interrupt routines

md_UserADCScope Takeover ADC sampling with interrupt on ADC sample complete, shutting down
		normal 5 KHz sample update.

		
md_VarEditServo1 Variable Editor controls one or two RC Hobby Servos (pins PB6 and PB7) using Timer 1
md_VarEditServo3 Variable Editor controls one or two RC Hobby Servos (pins PE4 and PE5) using Timer 3

md_VarEditServo13  controls upto 4 hobby servos using timers 1 and 3


md_VectorChars  Show use to vector drawn characters

md_WizDemo	Demo Menu created with Donkey Wiz Menu Designer
		Includings Donkey Wiz file then can be loaded into Donkey Wiz that created the menu.
